# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input. Specifically, the example shows a route that fetches a user by ID. However, it fails to handle cases where the provided ID is not a valid number, leading to potential application crashes or unexpected behavior.  The solution showcases how to add comprehensive error handling to prevent such issues.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. It attempts to parse the user ID as an integer without verifying its format, causing problems if a non-numeric ID is provided.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It includes input validation to ensure the user ID is a number before attempting to parse and use it.  This prevents the application from crashing and provides a more graceful response to invalid input.
